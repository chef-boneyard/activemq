## Usage

Due to the complexity of configuring ActiveMQ it's not possible to create a single solution that solves everyone's potential desired configuration. Instead this cookbook provides resources for installing and managing the ActiveMQ service, which are best used in your own wrapper cookbook. The best way to understand how this could be used is to look at the docs_example test recipe located at test/cookbooks/test/recipes/docs_example.rb

## Resources

### activemq_install

The activemq_install resource installs an instance of the Apache ActiveMQ binary direct from Apache's mirror site. As distro packages are not used we can easily deploy per-instance installations and any version available on the Apache archive site can be installed.

#### Properties

* `version`, String. The version to install. Default: '5.14.5'
* `home`, String. The top level directory to install software. Default: '/opt'
* `install_path`, String. The full level path to install software.
* `tarball_base_path`, String. The base path to the location containing the binary package of ActiveMQ. Default: 'http://archive.apache. org/dist/activemq/'
* checksum_base_path, String, The base path to the location containing the checksum file.   default: 'http://archive.apache.org/dist/activemq/'
* exclude_docs, [true, false], default: true
* exclude_examples, [true, false], default: true
* exclude_webapp_demo, [true, false], default: true
* tarball_uri, String
