[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/activemq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/activemq) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/activemq.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/activemq)

## Requirements
### Platforms

- RHEL and derivatives
- Fedora

### Chef
- Chef 12.1+

### Cookbooks
- java

## Attributes
- `node['activemq']['mirror']` - download URL up to the activemq/apache-activemq directory.
- `node['activemq']['version']` - version to install.
- `node['activemq']['home']` - directory to deploy to (/opt by default)
- `node['activemq']['wrapper']['max_memory']` - maximum amount of memory to use for activemq.
- `node['activemq']['wrapper']['useDedicatedTaskRunner']` - whether to use the dedicated task runner
- `node['activemq']['enable_stomp']` - Flag that decides whether or not to use stomp. Note: This is only used when `use_default_config` attribute is true.
- `node['activemq']['use_default_config']` - Flag that allows the option to use a basic configuration file

- `node['activemq']['enabled']` - Whether or not the ActiveMQ service should be started.  Defaults to `true`.

## Usage
Due to the complexity of configuring ActiveMQ it's not possible to create a single solution that solves everyone's potential desired configuration. Instead this cookbook provides resources for installing and managing the ActiveMQ service, which are best used in your own wrapper cookbook. The best way to understand how this could be used is to look at the docs_example test recipe located at test/cookbooks/test/recipes/docs_example.rb

## Resources

### activemq_install

The activemq_install resource installs an instance of the Apache ActiveMQ binary direct from Apache's mirror site. As distro packages are not used we can easily deploy per-instance installations and any version available on the Apache archive site can be installed.

#### Properties

* `instance_name`, String
* `version`, String. The version to install. Default: '5.12.0'
* `home`, String. The top level directory to install software. Default: '/opt'
* `install_path`, String. The full level path to install software.
* `tarball_base_path`, String. The base path to the location containing the binary package of ActiveMQ. Default: 'http://archive.apache. org/dist/activemq/'
* `sha1_base_path`, String. The base path to the location containing the checksum file.   default: 'http://archive.apache.org/dist/activemq/'

#### Example

```
# Install hello instance of activemq
activemq_install 'hello' do
  version '5.12.0'
end
```

### activemq_service

The activemq_service resource sets up the installed activemq instance to run using the appropriate init system (sys-v, upstart, or systemd).

#### Properties

* `instance_name`, String.
* `install_path`, String. The full path to the install directory.
* `env_vars`, Array. An array of hashes containing the environmental variables for env script. 

#### Example

# Set up activemq hello instance as a service
```
activemq_service 'hello' do
  action [:start, :enable]
end
```
